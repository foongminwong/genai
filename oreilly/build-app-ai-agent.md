1. [Chapter 1. Introduction to Agents](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-applications-with/9781098176495/ch01.html)
- Purposes of AI agents: Automate complex tasks. make intelligent decisions, nteract seamlessly with both humans and other systems, enhance productivity, improve decision-making, solve problems that were previously beyond what traditional software cannot tackle

a. What are Agents?
- Combine the power of large language models (LLM)
- "Software entities that perform tasks autonomously on behalf of users or other programs."
- Can take actions independently based on understanding of the environment and objectives, unlike traditional programs

b. Similarities and Differences from Traditional Machine Learning
- Traditional ML:
    - Process tasks e.g., image recognition, language translation, predictive analytics
    - Trained on large datasets to identify patterns & make predictions.
    - Cons: Operate within predefined boundaries and lack the flexibility to adapt to new, unforeseen scenarios without additional retraining.
- Agents:
    - Extend the capabilities of traditional ML by incorporating decision-making and planning abilities.
    - Use ML models, particularly LLMs, as a foundation but go beyond static predictions
    -  Can interpret the context, plan sequences of actions, execute skills, respond to changes in real time
    - Suitable for more dynamic & complex environments where flexibility and adaptability are crucial.

c. Recent Advancements
- e.g. OpenAI's GPT-4

d. From Synchronous to Asynchronous
- Traditional systems:
    - Operate in a synchronous manner/ linear sequence
    - Inefficient for tasks waiting for external inputs or processing large amounts of data
- Autonomous agents:
    - Operate asynchronously
    - Perform multiple tasks concurrently, react to new information as it becomes available, prioritize actions based on changing conditions
    - Minimize idle times & make better use of available resources

e. When Are Agents Useful?
- Agents:
    - Complex decision-making, real-time responsiveness, ability to operate in dynamic environments
    - Good at summarizing large amounts of info (extract insights), operating over unstructured text or info like emails, reports, media content, handling repetitive processes such as customer support, reasoning & interpreting textual/ visual info 
- Traditional ML:
    - Good in well-defined tasks, e.g., risk prediction or churn prediction
